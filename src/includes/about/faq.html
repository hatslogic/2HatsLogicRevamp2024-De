            <h2>Why Us ?</h2>
            <p>Have you ever tried outsourcing and failed or not satisfied? Mostly this happens due to problems like poor communication skills of the developers, cultural barriers, bad process etc. That’s where we come in. We are experts in cross cultural communication with extensive experience in working with European and North American clients</p>

                            <p>This is a very relevant question. We solve this issue with our excellent English speaking skills and understanding of your culture with the exposure of living and working in European and North American countries. We mentor our developers to understand the key points they need to keep in mind as well. We don’t just communicate with you via emails/chat but we encourage making skype video calls which also help to see who we are working with on the other end and make a good relationship. We consider each project as an opportunity to build a friendly co-operation. This also helps us share our culture with someone from another part of the world.</p>
