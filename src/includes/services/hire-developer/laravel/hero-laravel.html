Our code quality and coding standards are far ahead from what you would expect for an outsourcing agency. Our CTO is very particular about each line of code, class names, function lengths and even the spacing used in comment lines. We set the standards high and all new hires go thrugh a period of intense training even though they have passed through a set of strict coding tests and interviews. We also train developers with Vue.js so they are also comfortable in creating applications with cool user experiences.</p>
