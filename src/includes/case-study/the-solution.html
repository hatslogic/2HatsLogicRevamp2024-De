            <p>We built a mobile application using Flutter technology that communicate with the Shopware 6 APIs and display all the necessary information for any ecommerce business owner. This brings all the data available in a mobile app for the store owners. The solution is made with utmost ease of use. The store owners need to install a plugin in Shopware side and it displays a QR code. From the Shopware 6 admin app which they can download from the store they can scan this code and the website will be connected to the app and tha data will be available in the mobile app. The interface is highly intuitive. </p>
